# Configuration

The configuraiton options follow the available configuration files that Keycloak supports.

## Secrets

Some of the configuration values contain sensitive data and should be treated differently. These may include secrets, connection strings, etc. It is suggested that, depending on the available infrastructure and tooling, the handling of these values is done separately from other configuration values.
