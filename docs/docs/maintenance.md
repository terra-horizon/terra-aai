# Maintenance

The service is part of the TERRA platform offered through an existing deployment, following the TERRA release and deployment procedures over a managed infrasrtucture along with the maintenance activities that are scheduled within the platform. The purpose of this section is not to detail the maintenance activities put in place by the TERRA team.

## Healthchecks

The service [observability documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/observability/health) describes healthcheck endpoints that can be used to track the status of the service. 

An example of a healthcheck response that returns 200 OK for healthy state is:
```json
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "Keycloak cluster health check",
            "status": "UP"
        },
        {
            "name": "Keycloak database connections async health check",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ]
}
```
